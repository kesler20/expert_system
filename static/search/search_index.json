Vessels: Ambient Ambient Temperature and Pressure Vessel Description: Small and Medium Atmospheric Tanks (SMATs) have a capacity of less than 450 m\u00b3, can be of either plastic or steel, and operate at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Recommendations Safeguarding Notes Flame Arrestor Vent Overpressure Simple design similar to a free vent to atmosphere. Prevents external ignition sources from igniting flammable vapours in the tank. Continuous Venting via Control Valve Overpressure Can be routed to a closed system. Valve function can be observed remotely via human-machine interface (HMI). Reclosing Pressure Vent Overpressure Independent safeguard designed solely for pressure relief. Keeps tank isolated from atmosphere when not venting pressure. Continuous Inert Blanketing via Control Valve Vacuum Prevents air ingress from creating a flammable mixture in the tank vapour space. Reclosing Vacuum Breaker Vacuum Independent safeguard designed solely for vacuum relief. Keeps tank isolated from atmosphere when not breaking vacuum. High Level Alarms and Flow Shut-Off Overfilling Instrumentation for tank high level and flow alarms should be completely separate from the normal level and flow measurement with separate sensors and control units. Design Rules: Most atmospheric storage tanks are specifically designed so that the roof wall seam will fail preferentially to any other joint, and the excess pressure safely relieved, hopefully mitigating the effects of an accident. Pressure relief devices, directing the hazardous materials to a safe area, to protect the tank from overpressure. A vacuum relief device located at, or near, the highest point in the tank. Adequate venting capacity should provided for excess vapour generation. Overflow lines routed to a safe location and secondary containment.

Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: It is common practice to install a knock-out vessel with level detection in the suction of any compressor for which there is a risk of liquid accumulation in the suction line. The requirement depends upon the probability of liquid accumulation and the tolerance of the compressor to liquid.

Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: The flange breaking procedure should follow a colour coded system (e.g., traffic light system) for tagging the flanges. Red (broken), yellow (torqued) and green (leak tested). Following this, the tag can be removed. In maintenance procedures involving opening-up the process, ensure that process linework is both depressurised and free of hydrocarbons before breaking any flanges. Design Rule 3 Further reading: Hose and Couplings Basic, Average and Multi Safety-System Facilities Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: Design Rule 1 Design Rule 2 Design Rule 3 Further reading: Pipework Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: When defining the pipework inspection programme, areas of pipework that fall within the CUI (corrosion under insulation) temperature range need to be considered. The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of CUI; however, if the temperature is too high, the water will boil away and you will be left with a dry steam - so no CUI will occur. This is only relevant for carbon steel pipework. Consideration must be given to the implications and risks of CUI when specifying the paint specification for carbon steel pipework and the insulation specification, particularly around pipe supports and pipe hangers, which provide a possible entry point for rain into the insulation through the metal covering. By contrast, stainless steel suffers from MIC (microbial induced corrosion). Risk of chlorine induced corrosion of stainless steel if the temperature falls below the dew point of water within cooler parts of the process (due to chloride condensing out). Naphthenic acids (NAs) corrosion occurs in the 218-400 \u00b0C temperature range for most process pipework metallurgy. Refer to API 581 for more information. N.B. You're always allowed to overpressure pipework, provided it has been designed to ASME B31 (Code for Pressure Piping), and are allowed a certain number of hours at 110%, 120% and 133% above design pressure. Further reading: 1. ASME B31 (Code for Pressure Piping). 2. API 581 (Risk-based Inspection Methodology). Pumps Pump Casing Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: Typically, pumps are not insulated due to the difficulty in moulding the insulation around the pump. However, exceptions exist, e.g., in hot oil service in the 350 \u00b0C temperature range, insulated with a concrete block. VSD setpoints controlled, e.g., by operator, (key) locked in DCS or fixed locally. Maximum stall head of pump (at max VSD speed) is unlikley to be 2x the operating head; hence, can be taken at 30%. Pump maintenance is considered as minor maintenance. Hence, no pre start-up checklist is required afterwards. However, a line check should be carried out, whereby all valves in the nearby linework are checked to ensure the valves are in their correct positions. You don't want suction strainers on a pump. Instead, put a filter on the discharge side of the pump if you want to have a filtered product (as the discharge has a higher pressure). Consider the need to provide positive isolation (using a blank or spectacle blind) to avoid single valve isolation. Consider how to safely collect liquids draining from the pump body vent to prevent spillage to grade, and the PPE requirements to safely vent pump body. For example, the use of a metal can/tin to help collect any liquids. Further reading: Tankers Standard Tankers Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: FFS = fire suppression system. This is a typical safeguard for tanks against the risk of fire. Design Rule 2 Design Rule 3 Further reading: Road Tankers Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: Install hydrocarbon gas or VOC (volatile organic compound) detection in the vicinity of the loading (exporting) station to detect any venting or spillage during the road tanker loading process. Design Rule 2 Design Rule 3 Further reading: LPG Road Tankers Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: Design Rule 1 Design Rule 2 Design Rule 3 Further reading: Valves Manual Valves Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Always have operator training and start-up procedure. Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: You can either lock or car seal manual valves. Car sealing involves attaching a plastic seal to lock the valve, providing the operator with a 'memory jog' that this valve should remain locked in this position (e.g., open). It can be easily broken (e.g., to close the value in an emergency) without the need to lock/unlock with a traditional key and padlock. Lock manual valves open if they are required in essential, emergency safety service (e.g., purging) in order to prevent against accidental closure. Lock manual valves open on a minimum flow recirculation line to protect the pump. Further reading: Remotely Operated Shut-Off (ROSO) Valves Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: Interlock the isolation valve and pump to ensure that the pump cannot run whilst the isolation valve is closed. Nowadays, every pump has a remote start functionality. All isolation valves will have a failure position alarm, e.g., fail to open alarm. Design Rule 3 Further reading: Automatic Shut-Off (ASOV) Valves Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Header Title Paragraph Text Design Rules: Design Rule 1 Design Rule 2 Design Rule 3 Further reading: Speed Limiting (XSF) Valves Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Mechanical Minimum Stop Position This ensures a minimum flow at all time (e.g., through the tubes of a heat exchanger, reducing coking risk and extending the lifetime of the process equipment) Paragraph Text Design Rules: Any control valve on a cooling flow line should be fail open. All control valves should have a position deviation alarm to indicate if the valve is not in the correct position. Design Rule 3 Further reading: Non Return Valves (NRVs) Description: Describe what the item is. Recommendations Notes Mechanical Minimum Stop Position This ensures a minimum flow at all time (e.g., through the tubes of a heat exchanger, reducing coking risk and extending the lifetime of the process equipment) Paragraph Text Design Rules: The failure of a NRV depends on the service or process environment that it is installed in. However, when installed in a clean nitrogen service, the likelihood of failure is not considered as a credible scenario. Add NRV to \"critical NRV\" list and define a maintenance programme to ensure that it works on demand if there is an associated safety consequence of it failing (but not if the consequence is just an operational issue). In small bore lines, use a spring-ball NRV. In larger diameter lines, using a NRV with a 'flapper' will become large and heavy. Cannot claim a single NRV as a barrier when it's in dirty service and/or not subject to periodic inspection (i.e., not a safety critical NRV). Be aware of gum deposits as a sticky, gloopy mess that can stick NRV's open or closed. These are more prevalent in services at higher temperatures and where there is oxygen ingress. Occurs in diesel services but not MOLO.

Recommendations Notes Mechanical Minimum Stop Position This ensures a minimum flow at all time (e.g., through the tubes of a heat exchanger, reducing coking risk and extending the lifetime of the process equipment) Paragraph Text Design Rules: The failure of a NRV depends on the service or process environment that it is installed in. However, when installed in a clean nitrogen service, the likelihood of failure is not considered as a credible scenario. Add NRV to \"critical NRV\" list and define a maintenance programme to ensure that it works on demand if there is an associated safety consequence of it failing (but not if the consequence is just an operational issue). In small bore lines, use a spring-ball NRV. In larger diameter lines, using a NRV with a 'flapper' will become large and heavy. Cannot claim a single NRV as a barrier when it's in dirty service and/or not subject to periodic inspection (i.e., not a safety critical NRV). Be aware of gum deposits as a sticky, gloopy mess that can stick NRV's open or closed. These are more prevalent in services at higher temperatures and where there is oxygen ingress. Occurs in diesel services but not MOLO.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Part 1: Process Design Question 1.1 Q: Why is no corrosion allowance specified for stainless steel (SS)? A: Typically, it is assumed that SS does not corrode; hence, no corrosion allowance is specified. Question 1.2 Q: What value should be taken as the design temperature? A: The maximum operating temperature (MOT) + 10%, or add 10\u00b0C. Whichever value is greater. Question 1.3 Q: Can an alarm and trip in the same direction, on the same instrument item, be credited as two separate safeguards? A: No. However, if they are in different directions (e.g. high and low) it is acceptable to claim this as two separate safeguards. Question 1.4 Q: What is the standard guidance for using alarms as safeguards? A: If two alarms are greater than 20 minutes apart, they can count as two separate IPLs. This comes from the generic 15 minute timeframe assigned for an operator to complete the action from the first alarm, and an additional 5 minutes is added on top, to give a minimum of 20 minutes required between alarms. Question 1.5 Q: How can alarms be set if there are multiple design cases with large differences in the operating conditions? A: Consider a setpoint deviation alarm (rather than a fixed setpoint) which the operator can select depending on the operating mode. Question 1.6 Q: Can operator training and start-up procedures count as a safeguard? A: Yes. However, this does not qualify for reducing the likelihood with respect to risk ranking. Question 1.7 Q: What is the guidance on temperature instrument location around PSVs? A: PSVs are protective against overpressure, but not temperature. Therefore, it is important that any temperature instrument is located upstream of the PSV inlet line to ensure it is utilised effectively. Question 1.8 Q: Is there any guidance to be aware of regarding PSVs? A: Yes. Although PSVs are not currently included within this Expert System Tool, the following high-level guidance is included: (1) PSV inlet lines should be minimum length and sloped (ideally, vertically) to minimise the risk of deposition. If there is evidence of hydrocarbon deposits, there may be a requirement to heat trace the line. (2) The PSV inlet line size should not exceed the vapour line size that the PSV inlet line is connected to. For example, if the PSV inlet line size is 2\", the vapour process line size must be, at a minimum, 2\" also. (3) The design temperature of both the upstream and downstream lines of the PSV should be the same. (4) If a PSV is not added to an inspection programme, it cannot be used as a barrier, as it has not been inspected frequently enough to guarantee that it works. It is debated between organisations whether a PSV constitutes as one or two barriers. However, a single PSV in dirty service is not considered as a barrier, and additional factors must be added to claim it as a barrier (e.g. constant nitrogen or steam purge, or have two PSV's). (5) A thermal relief valve should be installed whenever a hot hydrocarbon line is re-inventorised with cold hydrocarbon. (6) A relief valve safegaurd is the 'written scheme of examination'. This involves a PSSR employee arriving on site, who periodically inspects the relief valve to ensure that it is working correctly. (7) If the PSV has a sustained intermittent flow, it can cause a 'hammer' effect whereby the valve lifts, vents and re-seats. This will damage the valve over time. * Note, for more information, refer to API 521 (pressure-relieving and depressurising systems). Question 1.9 Q: Is there any guidance to be aware of regarding analysers? A: (1) Provide a minimum margin of 2% between the alarm and the unsafe condition (e.g. flammable atmosphere) on an oxygen analyser. This is in line with industry-wide practice. (2) Include a sample point on the analyser to compare the sample reading with the instantaneous reading the instrument is giving. This acts as a calibration method. Part 2: Webpage Question 2.1 Q: What hazards does the Expert System focus on?. A: The system is focused on equipment and chemical hazards (e.g. autoignition temperature). However, some chemical hazards, including solids flammability and chemical reactions are not included. These hazards are beyond the scope of the current version of the tool, but are sought to be included within its future design. Question 2.2 Q: Why can I not find my specific chemical within the Chemicals Hub section of the webpage? A: At the present moment, the webpage is in the design stage, providing a minimum viable product (MVP) to validate the concept. It contains 23 chemicals; however, this number will be increased during subsequent iterations of its design to encompass a greater number of chemical compounds. Question 2.3 Q: Why can I not find my specific equipment item within the Equipment Hub section of the webpage? A: Similarly to Question 1.2 above, the Equipment Hub is still within the design stage; thus, may not encompass the full range of equipment items used within the chemical and process industries. However, as stated above, the database will be expanded to include a greater number of equipment items in future iterations of the webpage design.","title":"Help"},{"location":"help/#help-hub","text":"The Help Hub provides answers to common queries related to both process design and the Expert System webpage.","title":"Help Hub"},{"location":"help/#frequently-asked-questions-faqs","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"},{"location":"help/#part-1-process-design","text":"","title":"Part 1: Process Design"},{"location":"help/#question-11","text":"Q: Why is no corrosion allowance specified for stainless steel (SS)?
